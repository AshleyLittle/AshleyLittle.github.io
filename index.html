  <p>Most times, figuring out a solution is not the most difficult part of solving a problem. Usually, the hardest part of the problem is knowing how to solve the problem. It's impossible to convert from inches to centimeters unless you know the relationship between the two. The relationship betwen the two gives you a formula for solving the problem. Once you have that, the actual math part isn't too bad. The problem occurs when you don't know or have forgotten the relationship between the thing you do know and the thing yo want to find out. On top of that, some relationships are a lot more complicated than inches to centimeters and involve much more difficult math. There's really no reason for you to remember all those complicated formulas, not if you visit calculator.com, which you have.
